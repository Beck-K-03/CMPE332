Rental Database Video Demo
In a 3-5 minute video (videos longer than 5 minutes will receive reduced marks), show all the functionality that you were required to implement.  Your video should walk through the functionality and demonstrate that your program works.  Be sure to show us that if you add something to the database, it really has been added!    Videos should be uploaded to ONQ OR to Youtube (or any other hosting site) with a link provided in the comment section of the submission site.   If you upload to Youtube, you can make the video unlisted which means that only people who have the link will be able to view it.    If uploading to ONQ, your video must be submitted as an mp4.  Your video must include audio narration to let us know what you are showing.
